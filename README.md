## Oral Cancer Detection App

This mobile application, built with Flutter, leverages server-side machine learning to detect oral cancer. Users can take a photo of their mouth using the app, which is then sent to a server for analysis. The server processes the image using advanced algorithms to predict whether the person in the photo is likely to have oral cancer. This app aims to provide a convenient, accessible tool for early detection and awareness of oral health issues.
